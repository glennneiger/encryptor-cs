###this is my encryptor/decryptor and it works on any file or directory.
--
##**how it works**

###``this encryptor is using the aes algorithem witch is a very secure symetrical algorithem``####``meaning it uses the same key to encrypt/decrypt.``

##*_*⚠️the key  is 256 bit(32 byte) and there are 2 to the power of 256(1.1579209e+77) combanations⚠️*_*
--
##how to use

###1) ``when open program type the your command(e)encrypt, d)decrypt, c)close, g)generate key) type the letter that represend the command for exapmle: e.``
###2) ``trype the path to the file or directory you want to encrypt/decrypt if it is a directory then dont type the extensions. type extensions only if it is a file. for example: test.txt.``
###3)⚠️if you loose the key file or generate a new key then you will not be able to decrypt the files you encryptes. also the key will generate by him self if a key is invalid so dont change anything in the key file⚠️
